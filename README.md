## What is Working Memory?

Working memory is the cognitive system that allows us to temporarily hold and manipulate information. It plays a critical role in reasoning, learning, and comprehension. The capacity of working memory is limited, typically allowing us to keep about 7±2 items in mind simultaneously.

As we age, working memory can decline, making it more challenging to perform tasks that require multi-step reasoning or the retention of multiple pieces of information at once. However, just like physical exercise can strengthen muscles, mental exercises can help maintain and even improve working memory.

## How Does Mental Math Help?

Mental math exercises engage your working memory by requiring you to keep numbers, intermediate results, and operations in your mind while solving problems. Regularly practicing mental math can lead to:

- Improved focus and attention.
- Enhanced ability to perform calculations without external aids.
- Strengthened cognitive functions related to memory and processing speed.

By challenging your brain with increasingly complex math problems, you can train your working memory to handle more information more efficiently.

## How to Use Mental Math Drill

### Step 1: Set the Number of Operations

- Use the numeric input field to set the number of multiplication operations you want to include in each problem. For example:
  - Setting the number to **2** might generate a problem like: `(12 × 3) + (45 − 16)`
  - Setting it to **3** might generate something like: `(12 × 3) + (45 − 16) − (8 × 2)`

### Step 2: Solve the Problem Mentally

- Look at the generated math problem and solve it in your mind.
- Enter your answer in the provided input field.

### Step 3: Submit Your Answer

- Click the "Submit" button to check your answer.
- The app will display whether your answer is correct or incorrect and keep track of your streak of correct answers.

### Step 4: Repeat and Improve

- Continue solving problems, gradually increasing the number of operations to challenge yourself further.
- Aim to maintain or improve your streak of correct answers.

## Configuration Options

- **Number of Operations**: Adjust the complexity of the problems by changing the number of multiplication operations. This allows you to tailor the difficulty level to your current ability and push yourself as you improve.
